# play_it

PlayIt help you to keep or delete your videos.

Everything on the application can be controlled by your keyboard to avoid wasting time.

You will need libmpv2 to compile this app. You can get it here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/

### History

I used to play video i just get with vlc. But every time i found a video useless, i want to delete it. I want also to delete my personal video recorded with my phone quickly. However, vlc does not give the capability to do it easily. The best way is to work with the file explorer.
So this is why i created this app. By only be focused on the app, i gain time to filter quickly my videos.

### How to

There is a picture which explain how to use the app. This picture is also chown every time playlist is empty in the app. You can manage every control with mouse and with app.
